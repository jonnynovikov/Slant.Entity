/*
 * An example "repository" relying on an ambient DbContext instance.
 *
 * Since we use EF to persist our data, the actual repository is of course the EF DbContext. This
 * class is called a "repository" for old time's sake but is merely just a collection
 * of pre-built Linq-to-Entities queries. This avoids having these queries copied and
 * pasted in every service method that need them and facilitates unit testing.
 *
 * Whether your application would benefit from using this additional layer or would
 * be better off if its service methods queried the DbContext directly or used some sort of query
 * object pattern is a design decision for you to make.
 *
 * DbContextScope is agnostic to this and will happily let you use any approach you
 * deem most suitable for your application.

This means that this repository method has been called outside of the scope of a DbContextScope. A repository must only be accessed within the scope of a DbContextScope, which takes care of creating the DbContext instances that the repositories need and making them available as ambient contexts. This is what ensures that, for any given DbContext-derived type, the same instance is used throughout the duration of a business transaction. To fix this issue, use IDbContextScopeFactory in your top-level business logic service method to create a DbContextScope that wraps the entire business transaction that your service method implements. Then access this repository within that scope. Refer to the comments in the IDbContextScope.cs file for more details.");
