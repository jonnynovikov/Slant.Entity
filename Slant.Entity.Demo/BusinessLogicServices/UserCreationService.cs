         * (e.g. validation, initialization, sending notifications to other domain model objects...).

         * an implicit guarantee to whoever is calling us that the changes we make to
         * the system will be either committed or rolled-back in an atomic manner.

         * or none of them will. It would be disastrous to have a partial failure here
         * and end up with some users but not all having been created.
         *
         * DbContextScope makes this trivial to implement.

         * will join our top-level scope. This ensures that the same DbContext instance is
         * going to be used throughout this business transaction.
