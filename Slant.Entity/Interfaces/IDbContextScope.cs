/// You typically use a DbContextScope at the business logic service level. Each
/// business transaction (i.e. each service method) that uses Entity Framework must
/// be wrapped in a DbContextScope, ensuring that the same DbContext instances
/// are used throughout the business transaction and are committed or rolled
/// back atomically.
///
/// Think of it as TransactionScope but for managing DbContext instances instead
/// of database transactions. Just like a TransactionScope, a DbContextScope is
/// ambient, can be nested and supports async execution flows.
///
/// And just like TransactionScope, it does not support parallel execution flows.
/// You therefore MUST suppress the ambient DbContextScope before kicking off parallel
/// tasks or you will end up with multiple threads attempting to use the same DbContext
/// instances (use IDbContextScopeFactory.SuppressAmbientContext() for this).
///
/// You can access the DbContext instances that this scopes manages via either:
/// - its DbContexts property, or
/// - an IAmbientDbContextLocator
///
/// (you would typically use the later in the repository / query layer to allow your repository
/// or query classes to access the ambient DbContext instances without giving them access to the actual
/// DbContextScope).
