    /// When forcing the creation of a new scope, new DbContext instances will be
    /// created within that inner scope instead of re-using the DbContext instances that
    /// the parent scope (if any) is using.

    /// to the database when SaveChanges() is called in the inner scope regardless of whether
    /// or not the parent scope is successful.

    /// You would typically do this to ensure that the changes made within the inner scope
    /// are always persisted regardless of the outcome of the overall business transaction
    /// (e.g. to persist the results of an operation, such as a remote API call, that
    /// cannot be rolled back or to persist audit or log entries that must not be rolled back
    /// regardless of the outcome of the business transaction).
